# DOS-Protected-Mode
This is an assembly library which I wrote in the early 1990's for writing DOS protected mode games.  It provides mechanisms to activate protected mode on Intel 386 and later processors from within DOS, allocate memory via 32 bit addressing and accelerated functions to control PC hardware.

Features include:


- 320x240 video resolution (AKA mode 'X')
- double buffered video for smoother animation
- raster font support and printing of text
- colour palette manipulation
- image blitting with transparency
- draws lines, rectangles
- split screen mode
- mouse input through DOS driver
